# BreakOut
A Game Boy Advance BreakOut! Implemented in C
BREAKOUT! - By Ananda Badari.

Breakout is a GBA game modelled after the original BREAKOUT released by Atari. 

When you load up the game, you will see a Title Screen, and in order to proceed to the game, click "START" on your GBA, or "Enter" on a keyboard (All keyboard inputs are in parenthesis).
 
Then, you are taken to the Instructions page, where all the instructions are laid out. From this page, another "START" on your GBA, or "Enter" on a keyboard takes you to the real game. In the instructions page, there are ways to change the game mode and the game speed. 
	The game defaults to Original Breakout, and slow speed. However, clicking B (x) switches game modes from Original to Random. If the game mode is in random mode, then the blocks during game play are generated in random orientations, and in original mode, all the blocks are present. The game is in Random mode if the instruction is highlighted in Blue.

By clicking L (a) for fast mode, the ball moves twice as fast during gameplay, and the default paddle speed is twice as fast as well.
Then, clicking START takes you to the gameplay.

During gameplay, the goal is to break all the blocks without having the ball go past the paddle on the bottom of the screen. You can pause the game by clicking the A button (z), which will pause the ball and the paddle. A will also unpause the game. You can move the paddle by using the left/right arrow keys, and can change the speed of the paddle using up/down arrow keys. In order to move the paddle, you can click and hold, but you must repeatedly click up and down to change speed by more than one.

If the ball makes it past the paddle, the game is lost, the final score is displayed on the bottom, and it takes you back to the title page.

If all the blocks are broken, then you win the game, final score displayed at the bottom. This takes you to a special "WINNER" screen. From here, it takes you back to the title screen.
